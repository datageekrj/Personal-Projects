# Personal-Projects

Hello, Everyone, 

Thanks for Vising my Github. Here, I have listed all of my personal projects. 

1. [Automatic News Categorization using Top2Vec](https://github.com/datageekrj/Top2Vec_Project_New_Categorization): The objective was to create a system which will automatically categorize news articles into one of many categories which would help news creators and websites tailor and recommend the news which people want to see. For this,I have created my own dummy data on which a top2vec model was created after preprocessing the data. Finally, the model produced some 20 topics. 
2. [AI Investor](https://github.com/datageekrj/AI-Investor): The objective was to make an intellegent python script which will fetch the online stocks data and will give us recommendations as to whether we should "BUY" or "SELL" this in future. Allow us to also choose from some strategies. 
3. [Wikipedia Content Classification App](https://github.com/datageekrj/Wikipedia-app/blob/main/SolutionFile.ipynb): The objective was to make a user interface where someone can enter the URL of the Wikipedia page and the user will be displayed the context classification of the corresponding page. **Tools Used**: Requests and Beautifulsoup (for web scraping), regular expressions (for cleaning the text), Pandas and Numpy (for making the data), sklearn (for training the model), flask (for displaying the results to the User).  HTML, CSS and Flask to create a User Interface. 
4. [Job Skill Ranker Web Application](https://github.com/datageekrj/job-skill-app/tree/main/UI): Created a web application to scrape jobs from indeed.com and then extract their description and then rank the skills required for that job from these descriptions. Users can enter the title of the job and number of jobs to scrape from indeed. **Tools used** are Robobrowser, Pandas, Requests, Unigram and Bigram Models to Extract top skills. HTML, CSS and Flask to create User Interface
5. [Course Recommendation Application](https://github.com/datageekrj/Recommendation-app): Created a web application to recommend the users similar courses after the user selects one of the courses from the catalogue. Users can select one course and then select how many new courses to recommend. **Tools used**:  Pandas, sklearn for feature creation from text and for calculating cosine similarity. HTML, CSS and Flask to create a User Interface. The project can be seen here.  
6. [Bitcoin Future Price Prediction](https://github.com/datageekrj/Time-Series-LSTM-): Got past 7 days' price data of BTC from BinanceFutures API for a “1minute” interval and then trained the LSTM model on it. **Tools Used** are: Binance Future API, Tensorflow, Sklearn, Pandas and Numpy. 
7. [Twitter Sentiment Analysis](https://www.slideshare.net/RahulJha194/twitter-sentiment-analysis-122911144?qid=f44166f4-31bf): Given a trending word, it would give a pictorial representation of the overall live sentiment of that topic at that time. **Used** Twitter API and Matplotlib for this. The project can be seen here: 
8. [Interactive Visualizations Web Application](https://rahuljhabokeh.herokuapp.com): Created an interactive web application about how world demographics have changed. **Used** Bokeh Python Framework and data from gapminder on world demographics. The project can be seen here.  
9. [Time Series Analysis in Sktime (Python)](https://github.com/datageekrj/Time-Series-Analysis-in-Sktime): I developed a series of tutorials on Sktime package in Python, the notebooks files can be seen here.

Further, I have a [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeEsbCOjbSXao5dwqXLlJmQ) where I post things to further boost my skills and contribute in whatever way possible . 


Thanks you :)
