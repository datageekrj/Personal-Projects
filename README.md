3.  [Chat With Wikipedia] (https://github.com/datageekrj/Chat-With-Wikipedia) : üßë‚Äçüíª Chat with Wikipedia Application: Welcome to the Chat with Wikipedia web application! This application allows users to interact with Wikipedia in a chat format. Simply enter the title of a Wikipedia page, and you can ask questions about that page directly, and the app will return relevant information in a conversational way. This project leverages the power of Flask, Wikipedia API, and Google Generative AI for delivering dynamic, user-friendly chats. ü§ñ
4.  [Semantic Search Solution for Online Book Publishers](https://github.com/datageekrj/Search-Solution-using-Word2Vec): This project develops a semantic search solution for online book publishers, enabling readers to find relevant chapters based on the meaning of their queries rather than exact keyword matches. Utilizing nltk, gensim, and sklearn, this solution provides an intuitive and effective way to navigate extensive book collections.
6. [Automatic News Categorization using Top2Vec](https://github.com/datageekrj/Top2Vec_Project_New_Categorization): The objective was to create a system which will automatically categorize news articles into one of many categories which would help news creators and websites tailor and recommend the news which people want to see. For this,I have created my own dummy data on which a top2vec model was created after preprocessing the data. Finally, the model produced some 20 topics. 
7. [AI Investor](https://github.com/datageekrj/AI-Investor): The objective was to make an intellegent python script which will fetch the online stocks data and will give us recommendations as to whether we should "BUY" or "SELL" this in future. Allow us to also choose from some strategies. 
8. [Wikipedia Content Classification App]([https://github.com/datageekrj/Wikipedia-app/blob/main/SolutionFile.ipynb](https://github.com/fenago/mlsamples/tree/master/Wikipedia%20Content%20Classification%20Application)): The objective was to make a user interface where someone can enter the URL of the Wikipedia page and the user will be displayed the context classification of the corresponding page. **Tools Used**: Requests and Beautifulsoup (for web scraping), regular expressions (for cleaning the text), Pandas and Numpy (for making the data), sklearn (for training the model), flask (for displaying the results to the User).  HTML, CSS and Flask to create a User Interface. 
9. [Job Skill Ranker Web Application](https://github.com/datageekrj/job-skill-app/tree/main/UI): Created a web application to scrape jobs from indeed.com and then extract their description and then rank the skills required for that job from these descriptions. Users can enter the title of the job and number of jobs to scrape from indeed. **Tools used** are Robobrowser, Pandas, Requests, Unigram and Bigram Models to Extract top skills. HTML, CSS and Flask to create User Interface
10. [Course Recommendation Application](https://github.com/datageekrj/Recommendation-app): Created a web application to recommend the users similar courses after the user selects one of the courses from the catalogue. Users can select one course and then select how many new courses to recommend. **Tools used**:  Pandas, sklearn for feature creation from text and for calculating cosine similarity. HTML, CSS and Flask to create a User Interface. The project can be seen here.  
11. [Bitcoin Future Price Prediction](https://github.com/datageekrj/Time-Series-LSTM-): Got past 7 days' price data of BTC from BinanceFutures API for a ‚Äú1minute‚Äù interval and then trained the LSTM model on it. **Tools Used** are: Binance Future API, Tensorflow, Sklearn, Pandas and Numpy. 
12. [Twitter Sentiment Analysis](https://www.slideshare.net/RahulJha194/twitter-sentiment-analysis-122911144?qid=f44166f4-31bf): Given a trending word, it would give a pictorial representation of the overall live sentiment of that topic at that time. **Used** Twitter API and Matplotlib for this. The project can be seen here: 
13. [Time Series Analysis in Sktime (Python)](https://github.com/datageekrj/Time-Series-Analysis-in-Sktime): I developed a series of tutorials on Sktime package in Python, the notebooks files can be seen here.

Further, I have a [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeEsbCOjbSXao5dwqXLlJmQ) where I post things to further boost my skills and contribute in whatever way possible . 


Thanks you :)
